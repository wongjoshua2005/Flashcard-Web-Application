# Flashcard-Web-Application
#### Description: 
Charming Flashcards is a web application implemented using Flask, Python, Bootstrap, SQLite3, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. 
The purpose of this program is to allow users to not be distracted by other websites and make a loud beep. 
In addition, the web application has a simple and user-friendly interface in dark mode
to make your eyes more relaxed when studying. Although relatively simple, the web 
application utilizes the Pomodoro technique, a time management system to help manage their workload.
